title: Welcome to my website

Hi, my name is Ben. It's just Ben though, not Benjamin or Benedict or anything like that.

I've been trying and toying about with building a website for a long time. I'm never really sure what to build or what to do with it, so it's always not gone too well. That's probably true for this site as well.

I work in Analytics by trade, so my web development skills are virtually non-existent. I used [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to build this website, as I had used this in my work at Ubisoft.

Hopefully this site ends up being remotely interesting or useful for someone.

Let me know if you have any feedback :)

Thanks!

Ben
